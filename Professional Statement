What are your strengths (ones you currently have or plan to develop)?
- My strengths currently include a solid foundation in JavaScript and SQL, which I have applied in building backend functionalities for web applications, like the food delivery app I developed.
Additionally, I am continuously expanding my knowledge in Python, focusing on data analysis, automation, and cybersecurity applications. These languages enable me to build efficient and scalable 
systems, and I am committed to further developing my proficiency in them to handle more complex projects. As I continue building experience, I aim to deepen my expertise in both Python and JavaScript, 
exploring advanced topics like security protocols, encryption, and secure coding practices. This will allow me to contribute more effectively to cybersecurity initiatives, such as secure software 
development and threat detection. By mastering these languages, I can provide robust solutions that support an organization's security infrastructure.

What are your values?
I highly value integrity, continuous learning, and collaboration. In all my roles, from sales to technical projects, maintaining a high ethical standard has been a cornerstone of my work. 
Whether managing data or engaging with clients, ensuring transparency and accountability is key. I also believe in the importance of continuous improvement, as seen in my active efforts to enhance 
my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Collaboration is another critical value, as working effectively with others, whether in a team setting at Loweâ€™s or through cross-functional efforts 
in projects, drives success.

What interests you most about a career in cybersecurity?
I am drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to apply my analytical and technical skills in protecting critical data and systems. The challenge of safeguarding sensitive information against evolving 
threats is both intellectually stimulating and highly rewarding. I am particularly interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and data management, where I can contribute to secure database administration 
and protect organizational data from breaches and other security threats.

How can your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations?
My strengths in data management, programming, and problem-solving can support organizational security goals by ensuring robust and secure systems. For instance, my experience in database management will be 
valuable in maintaining data integrity and implementing security measures that prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, my values of integrity and continuous learning align with the evolving nature of cybersecurity, 
as I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest security practices and technologies. By leveraging my technical expertise and commitment to security, I can help organizations mitigate risks, protect their assets, 
and ensure that they are equipped to handle the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.
